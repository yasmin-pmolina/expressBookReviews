## FINAL PROJECT SCENARIO
In this project you will assume the role of a back-end developer working for an online retailer selling books. You have been tasked with developing a server-side
application that stores, retrieves and manages book ratings and reviews.
Your server-side application is required to provide the following features and capabilities to allow users to:
Retrieve a list of all books available in the bookshop
Search for specific books and retrieve their details based on the book’s ISBN code, author names and titles
Retrieve reviews/comments for specified books
Register as a new user of the application
Login to the application
Add a new review for a book (logged in users only)
Modify a book review (logged in users can modify only their own reviews)
Delete a book review (logged in users can delete only their own reviews)
(Multiple users) Access the application at the same time to view and manage different book reviews simultaneously
As is the case with most software development projects, different people in the team work on different parts of the application. Another front-end developer in
your team is working on the web-based client-side application that will communicate with your server-side application using REST. Therefore your job is to
implement your server-side application as a RESTful web service. A software architect on your team has written the skeleton code for your server-side
application using Node.js and Express.js



To complete the project you will fork the skeleton code into your own repo, clone it locally into your development environment, and develop the code further to
implement the CRUD capabilities listed above as HTTP methods in your Express server and test them using Postman. You will also implement Session and
JWT authentication to allow only logged in users to perform certain operations. For your reference, this application comes preloaded with all of the book
information.
Furthermore you will need to enhance your code using Promises, Callbacks or Async/Await functions to allow multiple users to interact with the application
simultaneously and not have to wait for each other’s operations to complete.
